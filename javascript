=> Everything in javascripts happens inside an execution context.
=> Javascripts is synchronous single-threaded language.
=> Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution context.
=> In execution context there are two phase:
   (1) Memory Creation : 
       In M.C everthing store in Key, Value pair.
       in variable case it allocate some memory to that and assign undefind value to it,
       in function it store all the code as it.
   (2) Code Execution :
       In C.E execute the code and assign the value.
=>  Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the  top of their scope
    before the code is executed. This means that even if a variable or function is declared later in the code, it can 
    be used before its actual declaration.
