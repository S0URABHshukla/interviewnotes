=> Everything in javascripts happens inside an execution context.
=> Javascripts is synchronous single-threaded language.
=> Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution context.
=> In execution context there are two phase:
   (1) Memory Creation : 
       In M.C everthing store in Key, Value pair.
       in variable case it allocate some memory to that and assign undefind value to it,
       in function it store all the code as it.
   (2) Code Execution :
       In C.E execute the code and assign the value.
